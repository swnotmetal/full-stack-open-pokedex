I have picked Java as the language of example for this task. At the same time, I took the liberty to explore how other several of high demanded languages are set up in the continues integration process, they all have followed more of less the similar principles, regardless of the application of varies different tools. The CI setup commonly starts with building a seamless pipeline for integration changes from different programmers, and the process should be heavily automated and reduce manual intervention (terraform to Jenkins to Maven + AWS Cloud). With Java, a team could use SonarQube and PMD to ensure code style and find out potential bugs (Linting), in testing, which should happen as early as possible, the team could use Junit or TestNG, to mock dependencies, and apply JaCoCO for code coverage measurement. Maven is perhaps the most popular tool for building, it complies code, runs tests and package applications to deployable format. 
Besides Jenkins there are tools such as AWS CodePipeLine, bamboo, cricleCI,GoCD, Azure DevOps.
Let us assume that this hyper-project written in Java is for a large e-commerce site that is estimated for half million visits per day. In this case, a self-hosted setup is a better choice: the team and management would have more control over the resource distribution, there are more rooms to configure without cloud platformsâ€™ limitations. The decision is often related to the purpose of the project, future plans, expected traffic and functions, and of course funds.
